NAME
    ORLite::PDL - PDL integration for ORLite

SYNOPSIS
      package Foo;
      
  # Load database and add statistics package
      use ORLite 'statistics.db';
      use ORLite::PDL;
      
  my $pdl = Foo->selectcol_pdl('select column from table');

DESCRIPTION
    Note: This is a very simple initial implementation, more functionality
    to come in the future.

    Compressed SQLite database files are a handy format for the distribution
    of bulk data, including statistical data.

    The ORLite Object-Relational Model provides a convenient way to create
    client APIs on top of these databases. However, its numberical analysis
    ability is limited to that provided by native SQLite.

    The Perl Database Language (PDL) is a high-performance library for
    numerical analysis in Perl.

    ORLite::PDL provides convenient integration between ORLite and PDL.

METHODS
  selectcol_pdl
      my $pdl = Foo->selectcol_pdl(
          'select col from table where country = ?', {},
          'Australia',
      );

    The "selectcol_pdl" method is added to the root namespace of your ORLite
    module tree.

    It takes the same parameters and returns the same results as
    "selectcol_arrayref", but automatically converts the result to a PDL
    "piddle" object.

    Returns a PDL object, or throws an exception on error.
